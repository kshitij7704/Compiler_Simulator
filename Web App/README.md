🌐 Compiler Simulator – Web Application
This is the web-based interface for the Compiler Simulator project, designed to simulate the phases of a compiler—from lexical analysis to target code generation—within a modern, responsive web application built with Flask and Bootstrap.

🚀 Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes user input into recognizable symbols.
Syntax Analysis: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens.
Semantic Analysis: Checks types and performs constant folding.
Intermediate Code Generation: Outputs simplified three-address code.
Target Code Generation: Produces pseudo-assembly instructions.
Responsive UI: Clean Bootstrap-based layout for smooth user experience.
Phase-by-Phase Output: Clear, structured display of each compilation phase.
File I/O Support (optional): Ability to load/save code (can be integrated from the GUI version if needed).
